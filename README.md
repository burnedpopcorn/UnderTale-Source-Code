Download the Source Code in the Releases Tab
> This mirror has not modified the Code at all

## Info
- This is a GameMaker Studio 1.4 Project, so anything newer will most likely cause problems
- This is probably a Decompilation, and not Leaked Code
- and this code isn't the best

###
Here is a Archive of the GMS 1.4 Installer
https://archive.org/details/GMStudio1.4.x

But there will be a GMS 1.4 Installer Archive in the Releases Tab

## ALSO
If you don't want to pay for GMS 1.4, you can use the link below for the Universal GameMaker Patcher, that can crack GM 8.1, GMS 1.4, and gives you all export modules for FREE
> Although I did not make this mayself, I have personally tested this for GMS 1.4, and it does work
